Far off, a cock crows.
The world keeps turning. 
Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mountains. You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.
The strong do as they will, the weak suffer what they must. 
Justice is done. 
Good riddance. 
A chapter is closed. 
You ignore their undignified sobbing. 
Guards escort them from the building. 
It was never going to last. 
It was doomed from the start. 
One must not shy from difficult decisions. 
He who hesitates is lost. 
Nothing beats the thrill of firing someone. 
Sic semper stultissimis. 
The earth continues turning. 
The stars set over the sea. 
Rain pounds against the street outside. 
They hang their pathetic head in shame. 
You could never have endured them for long. 
A great burden has been lifted. 
Soon they shall be forgotten. 
The next time you shall meet is in Hades.
