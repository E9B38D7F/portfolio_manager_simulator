You will regret this!!!
I am a disgrace.
Thanks, son's crying.
I knew I never had what it took.
A pox upon you all!
Remember me.
My disappointment is immeasurable.
Not like this. Not like this.
You never understood me. You never will.
Don't you see? Don't you understand what everyone says about you behind your back?
Can you write me a reference?
What, no feedback?
If you can't handle me at my worst, you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.
Stir not the bitter cup I mixed for myself.
Death is not the worst fate one can face.
Why do you bother combing your hair like that? Everyone can see you're balding.
As if the divorce wasn't bad enough.
I suppose now I can't afford medicinal herbs for my fragile daughter.
Spare me your pity.
Alea iacta est.
This displeases me.
Are you too much of a coward to request that I fall on my sword?
Moriemur inultae, sed moriamur.
The thread the Fates spun out for me reaches its end.
