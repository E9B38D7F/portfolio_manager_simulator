NAME, you're FIRED!
You will not let us down again, NAME.
You bring shame to our company, NAME.
NAME, it's time to go.
NAME, this world is better off without you in it.
NAME, your day has come.
NAME, this will not suffice. You must go.
NAME, I must do the inevitable.
The day has come, NAME.
You are not longer necessary, NAME. In fact, you never were.
