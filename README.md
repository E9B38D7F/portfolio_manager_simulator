You are an enterprising Roman citizen with 1000 sesterces, three analysts, and the dream of becoming a commodities trader rich enough to become the second Didius Julianus. 

Every year, each of your analysts will generate a strategy. Analysts with a higher "talented" stat will come up with strategies that have higher expected returns. Each analyst will also give you a backtest of the strategy. However, each analyst has secretly done a number of backtests and only shows you the backtest with the highest returns. Analysts with a higher "deceptive" stat will do more backtests, and so give backtests that more significantly overstate the quality of their strategies. Over the course of your life, you have attended too many lavish banquets and watched too many chariot races to keep up to date on recent advances in the statistical sciences. This means that your analysts' methodologies are all completely opaque to you, and all you have are the cumulative returns charts, which show your returns if you invested 1000 sesterces for a year. 

If you don't like any of the strategies your analysts have served up, there are two more options. The first is imperial debt, which pays a specified interest rate of between 1 and 5%. The Emperor is an honest man (and has many political enemies whose property he can expropriate) so he always repays his debts. The second is taking a punt on the chariots. Chariot racing is chaotic and each of the Red, Blue, Green, and White chariots always have equal probability of winning. However, to manage their exposures, the bookkeepers will sometimes offer odds that are not exactly 3:1. This means that there is usually a team it is positive expected value to bet on. However, you are a dedicated fan of the Blue team so the only team you will bet on is Blue.

At the end of each year you can fire analysts and hire more. Keep in mind that you have to pay them! They start at 50 sesterces per annum, and every time you use a strategy they came up with, the next year that analyst's ego inflates and their salary goes up 50 sesterces. To help with making these difficult decisions (and before selecting which strategy to adopt for the year) you can type in "HISTORY" to see all analysts' track records. 

Bona fortuna!


FAQs:
"Why can't I run multiple strategies per year?"
The strategies your analysts produce are mathematically advanced and computation-intensive. Even the most well-resourced portfolio manager has access to only so many abacuses and Greeks. 

"Why can't I use leverage to multiply my returns?"
It is many centuries before Irving D. Leverage comes up with the idea in 1898. 

"Why can't I reuse a good strategy the next year?"
This isn't Germania, this is Rome - markets are efficient, things move quickly, and alpha certainly doesn't last longer than a year. 

"Why can't I trade slaves?"
Please don't ask that question.
